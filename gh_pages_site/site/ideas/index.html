<p>A computer that you plug into the ground and it writes the rules for L-systems which make beautiful music.</p>
<p>A thing that converts musical patterns into a whole bunch of image formats following Rosa Menkman's vernacular of File Formats</p>
<p>map of a filesystem based on change and relation - a way to document my PhD?</p>
<p>A really cool project idea is to smash through all unicode as fast as possible, or make some kind of piece of work around it. Scrolling unicode characters look absolutely great.</p>
<p>open sourcing and changing. Not often done by the people who participate in art, so maybe some kind of art operating system? one that auto-commits to git once it has been modified by a person?
    - this could ask people to create their own experience and also maybe create things from experiences that have already taken place, but that could be in a nice abstract kind of way?
    - some kind of collective experience enabled through version control?
    - examining principles of open source(ry) through the fundamental parts of the work?    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A work that is a gallery of images that you download and run, and when it is run, you make an image and as a result of making that image some aspect of the work is deleted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A web browser addon that makes websites physically uncomfortable to use the more they monitor you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An autonomous music piece based around some kind of biological or computational principle. Game of life music would probably be the simplest implementation of this kind of idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a la Cardew - get an AI to make it's own form of notation which it then obeys to make a composition in SuperCollider based on the notation that it creates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>train a neural network to say free software bullshit and then release it as free software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A direct sonification of harassment tweets directed against marginalised communities in tech. Literally aplay *.txt - harassment as 'background noise of the internet'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An induction mic sonification of an abused thinkpad which is turned into messages somehow. Like the cry of the computer? Something like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absurdist small sonic and visual patterns based on Magno's Screenbashing performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A soelnoid-driven Arduino algorithmic player which algorithmically samples an object to algorithmically create 'object studies' in TidalCycles. This could all be done on raspberry pi maybe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand">Lavarand</a> - A material/digital linkup used in random number generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil and frequency-hopping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does free software mean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The autonomous forest. I can't remember what it is called, but maybe some kind of autonomous syntheizer generation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More things to do with chaos theory and chaos synths, taking 'Chaotic Map in curved waves' as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live code for literally the entire day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double/triple pendulum sonification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightification and patterns. Tidal DMX and lighting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Pasmore work was great, why? And how to take it forward?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Field Recording and working with field recording, I haven't done enough of this lately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The work of Zimoun, micro-macro synthesis, applied to music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music with Serial - Raspberry Pi/Arduino Random Synth? This could feed into the 'small patterns' thing, sonification and display of small patterns. Display of patterns as random garbage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw data through file formats is a thing I keep thinking about. How to articulate this in a project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patents, copyright and data: The continual copying of that Gnarls Barkley song into /dev/null is a nice touch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A work about the reliance of artists on Apple technology. Talk of 'openness' when using these systems is something that's still absurd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An album that is my hard drive tree encoded for a bunch of different audio formats!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A smartphone that is a brick. A brick that communicates to a whole bunch of APIs by arbitrary calls based on accelerometer data.</p>
<p>Brickternate reality - a brick that you put on your face where you can see through the holes and in the holes are beautiful descriptions from VC firms of what alternate reality is, accompanied by a dreadful binaural soundscape of absolutely nofhing.</p>
