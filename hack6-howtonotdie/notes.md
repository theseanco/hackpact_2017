# A performance idea

Provisionally called howToNotDie.py

a pseudocode performance, where I write an algorithm of how to not die of diabetes

I then upload it to GitHub or something.

This is a performance about proprietary software, proprietary hardware, my body, and my health

I will write a python script that summarises how I don't die, and how I maintain my own health, while explaining my relationship with proprietary hardware and software platforms

A performance laying out how I exist around proprietary software, why that is bad, and symbolically attempting to extricate myself from the relationship
