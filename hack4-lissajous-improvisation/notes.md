# Hack4 - Geometric Improvisation

- Uses various pure waves and frequency addition/division alongside a Lissajous scope backdrop
- Puts a feedback loop between sound and visuals
- Maybe write some kind of scheme for this? - it's an interesting topic, but would require some methodical effort
- Here's a YouTube video of an improvisation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7xTlPzvEM
