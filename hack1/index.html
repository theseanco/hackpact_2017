<h1 id="hackpact-day-1-sonic-pattern">Hackpact Day 1 - 'Sonic Pattern'</h1>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Inspired by '<a href="https://vimeo.com/148626379">Screenbashing</a>', a performance by Magno I saw at ICLC 2016.</p>
<p>Screenbashing writes a series of simple C programs in transparent terminals which display repeated symbol patterns.</p>
<p>It's then backed up by a bunch of (what I assume are) Viznut-style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9KLnN0GczI">'Single line of C'</a> programs implemented in SuperCollider.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do is more of these very small text repetition pieces, maybe in Python, and implement them in a way that will feed them directly to a sound card if possible, and then maybe extend that to some OSC or something like that, and maybe make some nice thing out of that.</p>
<p>This ties in nicely to a thing i've been wanting to tackle ages which is 'assigning messages as they come in' - i.e. a colour is assigned to a symbol when a symbol is sent to processing, and the colour for that symbol is kept constant. A simple thing that I've never actually done before.</p>
<p>I'm going to start with the simple 'C' programs though. I'm going to do them in Python because that provides more flexibility later and I also don't really know my C too well...</p>
<p>A thing to 'send it directly to sound card' could be something like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/aplay"><code>aplay</code></a> or <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"><code>sox</code></a></p>
<p><code>aplay -v -f cd *</code> is a nice format for CD-quality raw audio</p>
<p>Tends to come out as gated white noise, when given a few reasonably large example files</p>
<p>Starting with the python script to make repeated patterns, python's <code>print</code> puts a newline at the end of everything, so i'm going to use <code>sys.stdout.write</code> (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11266068/python-avoid-new-line-with-print-command)</p>
<p>It needs a very small sleep at the end otherwise it just spams printing in a way that's slightly unproductive</p>
<p>According to the original <a href="https://countercomplex.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/algorithmic-symphonies-from-one-line-of.html">viznut blog post</a>, the audio was being written as 'raw PCM audio' to the sound card.</p>
<p>This is done in C by writing to the sound card, i can just pipe it to <code>aplay</code></p>
<p><code>python 01_repeatingFigures.py | aplay</code></p>
<p>various options sound differently in various ways</p>
<p>I'd also like to view the output too... The issue is that the pipe only feeds to aplay. Need to pipe this in parallel.</p>
<p>Using <code>tee</code> does a version of it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5677201/how-to-pipe-stdout-while-keeping-it-on-screen-and-not-to-a-output-file), but there's quite a delay during it.</p>
<p>Also, after putting a <code>time.sleep</code> in the Python script i've now realised that sys.stdout.write doesn't work in conjunction with <code>sys.stdout.write</code>, why?</p>
<p>it's also not a problem with piping to <code>/dev/tty</code> as <code>/dev/stderr</code> does the same thing.</p>
<p>I'm also not flushing after writing to <code>stdout</code> which is an issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808832/problems-with-sys-stdout-write-with-time-sleep-in-a-function)</p>
<p>With all of that corrected, and a sleep added, playback through both sound and terminal is still a little bit jumpy.</p>
<p>The sound from the terminal output is also super static. Literally just a tone. That's not the most entertaining thing in the whole world</p>
<p>A repeated string of <code>'string'</code> produces the sound found in <code>01_string.wav</code></p>
<p>Let's try shuffling the string around and seeing if it mixes things up? This is a pre-done thing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6181304/are-there-any-way-to-scramble-strings-in-python</p>
<p>It just makes noise! Interestingw
If you add a bunch of spaces it adds silences but the silences are so small that it just kinda filters the sound??! this can be hear in <code>02_stringspace.wav</code></p>
<p>The issue with continuous sound and printing is in the amount of data that is flowing. If i cut down the string size and massively up the sample rate, both are constant(ish)</p>
<p>This produces disappointing results.</p>
<p>Maybe to better drive the point home the terminal printing and aplay sound be independent of one another. This would involve some kind of process separation or something</p>
<p>Or maybe I need <code>aplay</code> as a sort of subprocess.</p>
<p>A simple way to do this would be to start two versions of the same script in parallel. One that writes to the terminal and one that is piped to <code>aplay</code>, but i don't know how to do this...</p>
<p><code>python script.py &amp; python script.py | aplay</code></p>
<p>works, but it doesn't make the two scripts work in a way that they <em>actually</em> work from the same output. oh, and it makes them very hard to terminate</p>
<p>An interesting answer on stackoverflow here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260738/play-audio-with-python) says something about playing numpy arrays. i'll try</p>
<p>Doesn't work because it is not a numpy array, and thinking about it there is no reason why this <em>would</em> work.</p>
<p>Need to do this double-piping thing. Just not sure to make it work.</p>
<p>One way to do it would be to have a python script that recieves strings by OSC at a particular address with a listener. Then I can use the piping arrangement with two scripts running at the same time, that doesn't seem right. What I need is to run a shell <em>inside</em> of python...</p>
<p>Doesn't seem right, but it could be. Time to make a send script and a receive script.</p>
<p>I need to:
- Get the OSC Responder script
- Wire that script up to the inside of the printing script
- Test that in the context of the <code>aplay</code> piping option and the terminal output.</p>
<p>OSC Responder occupies a port and they can't be co-occupied</p>
<p>this is a problem.</p>
<p>Set up an OSC responder script alongside the piping I tried earlier, and it seems to work nicely.</p>
<p>A continuous input on the input script would be really nice.</p>
<p>Overall this just produces a series of boring beeps.</p>
<p>Actually a pretty dull result.</p>
<p>Start two terminal windows in the <code>Python</code> directory</p>
<p>in one: <code>python 03_1_OSCSender.py</code></p>
<p>In the other: <code>python 03_OSCHandler | tee /dev/tty | aplay -f cd</code></p>
<p>Enjoy the DC Bias and bleeps.</p></div>
