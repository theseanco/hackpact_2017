Empathy + Action
we harness the power of virtual reality & leverage it for social good.

A well-crafted narrative affords us the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of another.  Virtual really empowers not just to see, but also to step in, walk around & experience.  With VR  we can interact, feel & understand the point-of-view of another like never before.

VR is the most powerful storytelling tool on the planet.  Let us show you how to harness this power for your mission.

Once they've donned the headset the guest is immersed in the world of a refugee camp in Lebanon. Cheryl Henson, an IRC donor, says that via VR she was in a family's tent, watching children play.

"It's a very effective way to feel like you're there in the room because you have a real sense of these are real people," she says. "There's the food, there's the clothes, there's the talk."

'The power of virtual reality is its command of presence — its ability to transport the viewer into another world, and have him(!!) feel present in it. These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power, but once presence is achieved and sustained, it is breathtaking.'

'In V.R., we instinctively feel a surge of empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in. The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering, just as the killing of animals in the wild and in factory farms becomes a source of our pain as well.'

'How Virtual Reality Can Create the Ultimate Empathy Machine'

(talking about a woman in Syria) 'So, when you're inside of the headset. you're not seeing it like this. You're looking around through this world. You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions. And when you're sitting there in her room, watching her, you're not watching it through a television screen, you're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her. When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on. And because of that, you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way.'

'Now, with the advent of Virtual Reality, comes a new way to connect with an audience. A fresh medium, for charities to communicate the vital work they do. Allowing a viewer to understand a cause from the inside and actually see through someone else’s eyes, VR content has the ability to go beyond an appeal film and create a far more immersive experience – to highlight the plight in a more emotive way.'

'In full 360 degree surrounds, you watch a customer travel from California to Colombia, to meet the very child who benefitted from the pair of shoes they bought on that sunny day back in Cali. Taking their experience to the next level, TOMS also gave away 100,000 Google Cardboard headsets with their shoes, to enable their customers to fully appreciate the tangible impact they’re having. It’s this sense of connection and reality, that sets Virtual Reality production up for an exciting future in fundraising.'

'Virtual reality can bring us to the top of Mount Everest. But Stanford University researchers believe it can conquer an even steeper challenge: racial and sexual discrimination.'

'We’ll start using this as another teaching tool later this year," says Vincent, whose league still struggles with low numbers of women and minorities in top positions. "We want to be known as the best place to work.'

_An interesting couple of counterpoints from this article:_

'A January paper in the Journal of Social Psychology reported on a trio of experiments that showed "high-status groups," namely white males, were threatened by companies that stressed their pro-diversity message during mock interviews.'

'Fortune 500 companies and startups alike spend more than a collective $8 billion a year on in-house diversity training sessions that are largely ineffective and often counterproductive, says Frank Dobbin, a Harvard University sociology professor who has conducted numerous studies on diversity programs that date back decades.'

'Adding to the timely nature of this lab work is a new sense of mission at many companies to solve workforce inequality issues, especially at technology companies. For example, despite CEO-led efforts to radically improve diversity numbers at chip-maker Intel, women make up just 24% of employees, African-Americans 3.5% and Hispanics 8.3%.'

'It’s hard to deny the emotional impact that absorbing a news story in virtual reality has. In “The Displaced,” you’re meeting real kids who not only explain in their own words and voices the tragedy of their situation, but you’re actually in the rubble of their classrooms with them, and you’re actually in South Sudanese fields with the families, literally looking up into the sky and watching the aid packages parachute down from the planes above. You’re actually surrounded by real humans who are overjoyed, talking to each other, scrambling in the grass at your ankles to open up the dropped boxes of supplies.

In short, it really is like you’re there.'

'This is a very real example of the kind of immersive experience that Virtual Reality (VR) can provide. From tackling sexism, racism, and ageism, to gender-blind hiring processes and more flexible working opportunities, the possibilities are endless and exciting – particularly for women.'

'Right now the VR industry itself is enjoying an almost utopian, discrimination-free existence, according to a number of women I spoke to (though the majority of tech workers are male, of course).'

'“There are no rules, you don’t have to come from a certain background” explains Julie Heyde, a game developer at VR Unicorns. “It’s the wild west.“

So much so that horse-riding Heyde wears her jodhpurs to work and no one notices. Probably for the same reason that no one cares that she’s a girl: Heyde and her team spend their days with headsets on.'

'How Virtual Reality Is Inspiring Donors to Dig Deep for Charitable Causes

A 360-degree view of the world stirs empathy and action'

'After dinner and before the fundraising portion of the evening began, volunteers from the organization passed around Samsung Gear VR headsets so attendees could watch a virtual reality movie documenting a week in the life of a 13-year-old girl, Selam, and her family who were getting clean water for the first time. The video begins with the girl—whose mother died a year earlier—collecting water she fears is full of leeches and diseases. It ends with a team of workers arriving by truck to drill the well before water gushes into the hot desert sky.'

'Later that night, donors committed to giving $2.4 million, much more than Charity: Water had expected. That was the first time but not the last, Pent said, that the film led to higher-than-expected donations. During a visit to Charity: Water's office, one donor, who had already committed to giving $60,000, watched the film and was so moved by the story that he gave $400,000 instead.'

'"It's so hard to understand the water crisis when you just hear statistics, and it's about individuals who are going through this just because of where they live," Pent said. "Any one of us could have been born there, and we weren't. But we have the ability to help."'
