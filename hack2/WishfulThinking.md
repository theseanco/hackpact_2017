Once they've donned the headset the guest is immersed in the world of a refugee camp in Lebanon. Cheryl Henson, an IRC donor, says that via VR she was in a family's tent, watching children play.

"It's a very effective way to feel like you're there in the room because you have a real sense of these are real people," she says. "There's the food, there's the clothes, there's the talk."

'The power of virtual reality is its command of presence — its ability to transport the viewer into another world, and have him(!!) feel present in it. These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power, but once presence is achieved and sustained, it is breathtaking.'

'In V.R., we instinctively feel a surge of empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in. The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering, just as the killing of animals in the wild and in factory farms becomes a source of our pain as well.'

(talking about a woman in Syria) 'So, when you're inside of the headset. you're not seeing it like this. You're looking around through this world. You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions. And when you're sitting there in her room, watching her, you're not watching it through a television screen, you're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her. When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on. And because of that, you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way.'

'Now, with the advent of Virtual Reality, comes a new way to connect with an audience. A fresh medium, for charities to communicate the vital work they do. Allowing a viewer to understand a cause from the inside and actually see through someone else’s eyes, VR content has the ability to go beyond an appeal film and create a far more immersive experience – to highlight the plight in a more emotive way.'

'In full 360 degree surrounds, you watch a customer travel from California to Colombia, to meet the very child who benefitted from the pair of shoes they bought on that sunny day back in Cali. Taking their experience to the next level, TOMS also gave away 100,000 Google Cardboard headsets with their shoes, to enable their customers to fully appreciate the tangible impact they’re having. It’s this sense of connection and reality, that sets Virtual Reality production up for an exciting future in fundraising.'
