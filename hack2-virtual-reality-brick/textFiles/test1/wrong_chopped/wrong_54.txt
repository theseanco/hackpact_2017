Taking their experience to the next level, TOMS also gave away 100,000 Google Cardboard headsets with their shoes, to enable their customers to fully appreciate the tangible impact they’re having. It’s this sense of connection and reality, that sets Virtual Reality production up for an exciting future in fundraising.'
